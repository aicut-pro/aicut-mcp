# aicut

aicut is a hosted MCP server at `https://mcp.aicut.pro/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, OAuth 2.1 with
dynamic client registration). The user signs in with their own aicut account once; generations
spend tokens from that account at app prices and land in its library. There is nothing to install
and no API key to set.

## Connect (once)

If the `aicut` tools (`list_models`, `generate_video`, ...) are not available yet, add the server:

- **OpenClaw:** add it under `mcp.servers` in your OpenClaw config, then sign in:

  ```json
  { "mcp": { "servers": { "aicut": { "url": "https://mcp.aicut.pro/mcp", "transport": "streamable-http", "auth": "oauth" } } } }
  ```

  ```bash
  openclaw mcp login aicut
  ```

- **Claude Code:** `claude mcp add --transport http aicut https://mcp.aicut.pro/mcp`, then `/mcp`,
  pick `aicut`, Authenticate.
- **Any other MCP client:** point it at `https://mcp.aicut.pro/mcp` over Streamable HTTP and
  complete the browser sign-in. Agents with no browser can use an aicut API key as a bearer token;
  keys are issued by hand via support@aicut.pro.

## How to use it

1. **Catalog first.** Call `list_models` before naming a model or a setting; model ids, durations
   and aspect ratios cannot be guessed. Narrow it with `query`, `tags` or `type`.
2. **Read the recipe.** Before a flow's first call, call `get_recipe` for it (`story-episode`,
   `starter-*`, `talking-avatar`, `motion-control`) and follow it.
3. **Price, then ask.** Every `generate_*` tool takes `estimate_only: true`. Quote the price and
   what it buys in the same message as your question, and spend only after the user's explicit go
   for that one purchase. Call `get_balance` before the first ask; if it returns `top_up_url`,
   give the user that link and stop.
4. **Wait properly.** Videos take one to three minutes, sometimes six. After a `generate_*` call,
   call `wait_for_generation` again while it answers `terminal: false`. If it answers
   `awaiting_user: true`, stop and ask the user.
5. **Stories are staged.** An AI Video Story episode is cast (free, `generate_cast`), portraits,
   start frames (`generate_story_video`), fire (`fire_story_video`) and render
   (`render_story_video`); each paid stage is its own priced ask. Firing cannot be undone. Use
   `browse_series` then `list_series` to pick a series.
6. **Publishing.** `prepare_post` and `review_post` send nothing. Only `publish_post` posts, and it
   cannot be taken back: show the user the review and get a go first.
7. **Consent.** Use pictures of real people only with their permission, never public figures.

## Good first prompts

- "Use aicut with Veo 3.1 to make a cinematic 8-second vertical opener for a faceless TikTok
  channel, and tell me what it costs before you generate it."
- "List aicut's trending niches and make one about my coffee shop."
- "Make a 30-second AI Video Story episode in a series of your choice; show me the cast first."
- "Post my latest aicut video to my connected TikTok, and show me the review before it sends."
